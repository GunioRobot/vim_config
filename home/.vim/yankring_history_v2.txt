The providers of these products and services (each, a &ldquo;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Provider</span>&rdquo;) make the deals available to us on the condition that a minimum number are purchased (the &ldquo;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Deal Minimum</span>&rdquo;). Each product or service we promote on the Website (a &ldquo;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">deal</span>&rdquo;) will be available for a limited time.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to participate in the deals we offer on the Website, you must create and maintain a valid Website account. Your Website account is valid when all information is complete and accurate and is not restricted or terminated by us.</p>\r\n<p>Each deal you order on the Website is an offer from you to purchase the deal. If we receive orders for at least the Deal Minimum for such deal, then your order will be processed, you will be charged, and we will send you an email that contains a link to an Internet location where you can print a voucher for your purchased deal. If orders for a given deal do not reach the Deal Minimum before the deal is removed from the Website, the deal will terminate and all orders for such deal will not be processed and you will not be charged.</p>\r\n<p>Pursuant to these Terms of Use, we sell vouchers on the Website that can be redeemed for products and services. The Providers sell the products and services for which the vouchers are redeemable. The Providers, not us, are responsible for all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by any person that uses, redeems, or attempts to use or redeem a voucher.</p>\r\n<h3>Section XV<br />General Deal Terms</h3>\r\n<p>With respect to a given deal, unless otherwise set forth in the Details of such deal, permitted by the respective Provider, or otherwise required by law:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>neither we nor the respective Provider is responsible for lost or stolen vouchers</li>\r\n<li>vouchers for beverages can only be used consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations</li>\r\n<li>vouchers cannot be used in combination with other offers, certificates, coupons or promotions</li>\r\n<li>vouchers only apply to products and services, not shipping, handling, taxes, tips or otherwise</li>\r\n<li>no refunds or store credit for partial use of voucher (there is no incremental use)</li>\r\n<li>reproduction or sale of vouchers is prohibited</li>\r\n<li>vouchers expire on the date specified on the voucher</li>\r\n<li>vouchers are void to the extent prohibited by law</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We are not obligated to make refunds. All refunds will be offered in our sole and absolute discretion; provided that no refunds will be provided after the expiration of 30 days following the date of purchase.</p>"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             StaticText.create :key => "privacyPolicy", :friendly_name => "Privacy Policy", :text => "<p><strong>READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.

Each product or service we promote on the Website (a &ldquo;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">deal</span>&rdquo;) will be available for a limited time.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to participate in the deals we offer on the Website, you must create and maintain a valid Website account. Your Website account is valid when all information is complete and accurate and is not restricted or terminated by us.</p>\r\n<p>Each deal you order on the Website is an offer from you to purchase the deal. If we receive orders for at least the Deal Minimum for such deal, then your order will be processed, you will be charged, and we will send you an email that contains a link to an Internet location where you can print a voucher for your purchased deal. If orders for a given deal do not reach the Deal Minimum before the deal is removed from the Website, the deal will terminate and all orders for such deal will not be processed and you will not be charged.</p>\r\n<p>Pursuant to these Terms of Use, we sell vouchers on the Website that can be redeemed for products and services. The Providers sell the products and services for which the vouchers are redeemable. The Providers, not us, are responsible for all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by any person that uses, redeems, or attempts to use or redeem a voucher.</p>\r\n<h3>Section XV<br />General Deal Terms</h3>\r\n<p>With respect to a given deal, unless otherwise set forth in the Details of such deal, permitted by the respective Provider, or otherwise required by law:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>neither we nor the respective Provider is responsible for lost or stolen vouchers</li>\r\n<li>vouchers for beverages can only be used consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations</li>\r\n<li>vouchers cannot be used in combination with other offers, certificates, coupons or promotions</li>\r\n<li>vouchers only apply to products and services, not shipping, handling, taxes, tips or otherwise</li>\r\n<li>no refunds or store credit for partial use of voucher (there is no incremental use)</li>\r\n<li>reproduction or sale of vouchers is prohibited</li>\r\n<li>vouchers expire on the date specified on the voucher</li>\r\n<li>vouchers are void to the extent prohibited by law</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We are not obligated to make refunds.
